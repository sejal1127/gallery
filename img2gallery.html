                                Taj Mahal Palace Hotel was specifically chosen by Lashkar-e-Taiba, a terror group who attacked multiple targets,[20] for an attack intended to strike "a blow against a symbol of Indian wealth and progress".[21] The hotel was attacked on 26 November 2008, during which material damage occurred, including the destruction of the hotel's roof in the hours following.[22] Hostages were taken during the attacks, and at least 167 people were killed, including many foreigners. The casualties were mostly Indian citizens, although westerners carrying foreign passports were singled out.[23] Indian commandos killed the terrorists barricaded in the hotel, to end the three-day battle on 29 November.[24] At least 31 died at the Taj. Approximately 450 people were staying in the Taj Mahal Palace and Hotel at the time of the siege.[25] The attack was planned using information compiled by David Headley, a Pakistani-American, who had stayed at the hotel multiple times.
<br><br>
Soon after this on 30 November, Tata chairman Ratan Tata said in an interview with CNN's Fareed Zakaria that they had received advance warning of the attacks and that some countermeasures had been taken. These may have been relaxed before the attack, but in any case were easily sidestepped by the operatives.[26]
<br><br>
The less-damaged sections of the Taj Mahal Palace and Tower hotel reopened on 21 December 2008. It took several months to rebuild the popular heritage section of the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel.

                              <p>The Statue of Liberty is 92 meters/ 305 ft high and is made of a iron structure with copper skin.
<br><br>
                                Lady Liberty, as the statue often is referred to, was designed by Frederic Auguste Bartholdi and the massive iron skeleton of the lady was designed by Alexandre Gustave Eiffel who also designed the Eiffel Tower.
                                <br><br>
                                The statue was built and completed in France in 1884. The monument was then disassembled into 350 pieces and packed into 214 crates and shipped to New York. The Statue of Liberty was a gift of the people of France to the American people on the American Centennial in 1886. The torch’s flame is covered with 24k gold and the crown has seven rays for the seven continents.
                                <br><br>
                                The monument stands on Liberty Island in the Hudson River facing New York City. You can climb up the 154 steps from the pedestal to the head of the statue where you can see the fantastic views over the 'Big Apple' as New York is often lovingly called. </p>

<br><br>
                                The 324metres/1062ft high Eiffel Tower was constructed by Auguste Eiffel and a team of engineers. If you would like to take the steps up to the tower viewing platform on the second floor, there are 704 steps to climb, but luckily there are also lifts in each of the leg up to the second floor.
                                <br><br>
                                The tower has been visited by over 250 million people since its opening and in 2016 more than 7 million visitors were welcomed on the tower's top platform! More info about the Eiffel Tower and facts for children about the famous landmark here.</p>

                              <p>The Sydney Opera House, built in Australia’s biggest city, is famous for its roof’s architecture resembling shells or sails. The opera house was designed by Jørn Utzon from Denmark and it was built between 1959 and 1973.
<br><br>

                                <br><br>

<br><br>
                                The Egyptian pyramids were built during a time when there was only manual labour and no machine lifting equipment available. The pyramids were build to house the bodies of the pharaoh who ruled in ancient Egypt. Next to the Giza pyramids there is the Sphinx, the famous monument of a lion body with a pharaoh’s head.</p>

<br><br>
                                The wall is also referred to as ‘Long Wall’ as it is over 21,196 km/13,171 miles long. It was built with stones, bricks and tiles, earth as well as of wooden material. The wall was completed in 1644, but it took more than 2,000 years to build.
                                <br><br>
                                There are more than 20,000 watchtowers along the wall as it was built to protect the country against invasions from nomads and enemies and to make it easier to collect duty for goods that were transported along the Silk Road.</p>
